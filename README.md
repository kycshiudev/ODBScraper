Thanks for choosing the ODBScraper Daily Devotional Generator!

This Java based generator puts the articles publicly available at odb.org into nicely formatted doc/rtf files.  The format of these files are determined by user selected templates.  Some are included in the 'templates' folder of this project.

The generated devotionals currently are set to grab 7 days worth of articles.  In the future, this may become customizable.

How to Use:
1. Input the url of the first date you want the file to include
2. Click the browse button next to the 'Path to template' field and select the template you would like to use.  If you are not sure which to use, select 'newpage_rtf.rtf'. (optionally, you can type in the full path of the file you want to select.  e.g.: 'C:\Users\username\Desktop\test.rtf')
3. Click the browse button next to the 'Output file name' field and select a location and input a file name for the file to be generated.  (optionally, you can type in the full path of the file you want to save.  e.g.: 'C:\Users\username\Desktop\test.doc')
4. Click the OK button and wait for the text 'DONE!' to appear below the OK button.
5. Go to the location you specified in step 3 and you should see the file generated!
